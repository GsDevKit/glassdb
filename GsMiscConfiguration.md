## Loading ##
You _can_ load the entire package using the following expression:

```
  Gofer project load: 'GsMisc'.
```

However, unlike many projects, this project is just a collection of miscellaneous packages so it is more likely that you will be interested in loading one package (mail support):
```
  Gofer project load: 'GsMisc' group: 'SMTPMail'.
```

or a couple of packages (like SIXX and Utf8Encoding):

```
  Gofer project load: 'GsMisc' group: #('SIXX' 'Utf8Encoding').
```
Note that in the case of 'SIXX' which relies on the 'XML-Parser', the dependent packages are automatically loaded for you.
