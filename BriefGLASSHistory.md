#### 2007 ####
In December of 2007 I created the [GLASS repository](http://seaside.gemstone.com/ss/GLASS.html).

#### 2008 ####
In January of 2008 the [first mention of the GLASS package](http://gemstonesoup.wordpress.com/2008/01/29/gemstones-64-version-224-is-shipping/) was made (GLASS-dkh.57).

In June of 2008 the [first special upgrade instructions](http://gemstonesoup.wordpress.com/2008/06/11/glass-beta-update-glass-dkh118-glass230-dkh145/) were written for upgrading to GLASS-dkh.118.

In July of 2008 the [first back reference](http://gemstonesoup.wordpress.com/2008/07/15/glass-beta-update-glass-dkh119-glass230-dkh150/) (i.e., _if you are running version Y, follow these steps first_) included in upgrade instructions (GLASS-dkh.119).

In December of 2008 the [GemTools Launcher was introduced](http://gemstonesoup.wordpress.com/2008/12/24/glass-beta-update-tools-tuneup-preview/) as a Preview.

#### 2009 ####
In January of 2009 the [first complex update process](http://gemstonesoup.wordpress.com/2009/01/21/glass-beta-update-simplified-updating-preview-continued/) was introduced.

In March of 2009 the **Update... button** was introduced in the GemTools Launcher that permitted one to [update the client and the server](http://gemstonesoup.wordpress.com/2009/03/16/terse-guide-to-the-new-glass-tools/#updatesteps) without complicated instructions.

In April of 2009, the [new (incompatible) Hyper version](http://gemstonesoup.wordpress.com/2009/04/15/glass-beta-update-working-with-soap-preview/) introduced.

In April of 2009 I started development on [Metacello](http://code.google.com/p/metacello/).

In May of 2009 [GLASS.230-dkh.231 released](http://gemstonesoup.wordpress.com/2009/05/12/glass-beta-update-fixin-some-bugs-preview/). GLASS.230-dkh.231 is the most recent GLASS release (ignoring the bootstrapping series of releases: GLASS 1.0-beta.0 through GLASS 1.0-beta.7).

In October of 2009 [Gemtools 1.0-beta.0 released](http://gemstonesoup.wordpress.com/2009/10/15/gemtools-client-1-0-beta-0/), first GemTools release using [Metacello](http://code.google.com/p/metacello/).

In November of 2009 the [GLASS 1.0-beta.0 released](http://gemstonesoup.wordpress.com/2009/11/04/bootstrapping-glass-1-0-beta-0/) using [Metacello](http://code.google.com/p/metacello/). No upgrade path from GLASS.230-dkh.231 was available.

In December of 2009 [GLASS 1.0-beta.5 released](http://gemstonesoup.wordpress.com/2009/12/16/bootstrapping-glass-1-0-beta-5/). Still no upgrade path.

#### 2010 ####
In May 2010 GLASS 1.0-beta.8 should be released. GLASS 1.0-beta.8 will be the first release with an upgrade path for GLASS.230-dkh.231.
