When you press the **Logout** button or execute the **Logout command** the selected session is terminated and all of the GemTools windows associated with the session are closed.

When a GemStone gem terminates, itâ€™s log file is automatically deleted. The log file is not deleted if the gem terminates unexpectedly.
