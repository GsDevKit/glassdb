GemStone/S supports breakpoints, so it isn’t always necessary to edit a method to get the debugger to stop at an interesting point. The definition pane menu in the code browsers and debugger has a ‘set breakpoint’ item that will set a breakpoint at the selected point in a method. For a method that has a breakpoint set, an additional menu item, ‘clear method breakpoints’, shows up and allows you to clear all of the breakpoints in the selected method. If a breakpoint is set on any method in the system, a ‘clear ALL breakpoints’ method shows up on all of the definition pane menus and will clear all the breakpoints in your session when selected.

Breakpoints are session-based and are associated with a particular instance of a method. If the method changes by either code changes on your part or the method is changed via an update via a commit or abort, then the previously set breakpoints aren’t active on the new instance of the method.
