By default a session workspace named GLASS is displayed (and created if necessary). Use **ctl-S** to save the workspace contents.

There are menu items on both the [View... menu](GemToolsView.md) and [Tools... menu](GemToolsTools.md) for opening a workspace window on the list of session workspaces.

Session workspaces are persisted in your repository by name in a StringKeyValueDictionary stashed in `UserGlobals at: #SqueakWorkspace`.
